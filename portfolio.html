      Edie joined IBM in 1958. There she worked her way up to senior systems programmer, the highest technical ranking at the time and was one of the leading women in technology at the time. She left the company at 1975 to focus on her LGBTQ activism. In  2009 when her partner Thea Spyer passed away, Edie was required to pay $363,053 in federal estate taxes because the government did not recognize the validity of her marriage to Spyer. She brought this to court and it eventually became a part of the case to strike down DOMA in 2013. Because of this, she gained national recognition as a LGBTQ advocate.

      “If you have to outlive a great love, I can’t think of a better way to do it than being everybody’s hero. Suddenly I’m exalted, instead of being this goofy old lady, which is what I feel like.”
