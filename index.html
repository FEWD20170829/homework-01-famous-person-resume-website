    <p>Bonjour! I'm Julia Child, an American-born chef and author of the bestselling cookbook <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-1/dp/0394721780" target="_blank"><i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i></a>. You may also know me from my long-running TV show, <i>The French Chef</i>, or from Meryl Streep's portrayal of me in the 2009 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/"><i>Julie & Julia</i></a>, released five years after my death.</p>

    <p>I fell in love with French food in the late 1940s, learned how to cook it, and never turned back.</p>
